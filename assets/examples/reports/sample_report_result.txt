text[[620, 216, 893, 279]]
is called the augmented matrix of the system. (The second row here contains a zero because the second equation could be written as \(0 \cdot x_{1} + 2x_{2} - 8x_{3} = 8\) .) An augmented matrix of a system consists of the coefficient matrix with an added column containing the constants from the right sides of the equations.

The size of a matrix tells how many rows and columns it has. The augmented matrix (4) above has 3 rows and 4 columns and is called a \(3 \times 4\) (read "3 by 4") matrix. If \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, an \(m \times n\) matrix is a rectangular array of numbers with \(m\) rows and \(n\) columns. (The number of rows always comes first.) Matrix notation will simplify the calculations in the examples that follow.
